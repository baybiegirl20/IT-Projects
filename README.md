IT Projects Repository

Welcome! This repository is organized into two primary branches based on focus areas:

Networking-Projects Branch  – for all hands-on networking work

Cybersecurity-Projects Branch  – for cybersecurity-focused labs and explorations

Each branch includes lab environments, configuration files, tools used, screenshots, and summaries of what I’ve learned through each build or test.

Branch Overview

Networking-Projects

Projects under this branch focus on:

Network design & planning

Cisco device configuration (routers, switches, etc.)

Hands-on labs using Packet Tracer

Show commands, routing tables, and troubleshooting steps

Example project types:

Topology builds

Subnetting and IP addressing

Static and dynamic routing labs

Cybersecurity-Projects

Projects in this branch highlight:

Vulnerability scanning

Introductory penetration testing

Use of tools in Kali Linux

Exploits run against Metasploitable2 and other intentionally vulnerable systems

Example project types:

VM-based lab exercises

Port scanning, enumeration, and exploitation

Network hardening and system defense testing

Tools & Environments

Cisco Packet Tracer – networking simulations

Kali Linux / Metasploitable2 – penetration testing labs

VirtualBox / VMware – VM-based testing environments

Command-line tools – used across both tracks for diagnostics and control

Purpose

This repo is my learning playground — a place to track what I’ve worked on, experiment with tools and techniques, and build a strong foundation across Networking and Cybersecurity. Each project documents the challenges, solutions, and hands-on knowledge I gain over time.
