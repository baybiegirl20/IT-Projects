LabCore Network Design
This project covers the design, configuration, and testing of a network using Cisco Packet Tracer. It includes startup configurations, command output screenshots, topology diagrams, troubleshooting notes, and verification results. Everything is organized into folders with links for easy reference.

Folder Structure
All screenshots and related files are stored in the LabCore Network Design Screenshots folder, divided as follows:

Router/ – Configuration screenshots and outputs from the router

Switch 1/ – Screenshots of Switch 1 configurations

Switch 2/ – Not included in the main document since it’s very similar to Switch 1, but configs were done and verified

Show Commands/ – Screenshots of all required show commands (like show ip interface brief, show vlan brief, etc.)

Topology/ – Starting and completed network topology diagrams

Test & Verify/ – Results from connectivity tests (pings, traceroutes)

Troubleshooting/ – Screenshots and notes on issues encountered and how they were resolved

Lessons Learned
This project helped me get hands-on experience with core network concepts like VLANs, inter-VLAN routing, and device configuration. It reinforced how important it is to verify configurations using show commands and methodically troubleshoot issues. Documenting the process and organizing files clearly made reviewing and sharing the project much easier.
